# Orchestration and Execution Dependencies
1. Orchestrator (e.g., Apache Airflow, Dagster) - Code needs scheduled execution, dependency management (e.g., run SQL after CSV is loaded), monitoring, and retry logic.

2. Containerization (e.g., Docker) - Packaging Python code, dependencies, and system configuration into an immutable unit ensures it runs identically on any server (your dev machine, staging, production).

3. Dependency Management - A clear, locked-down list of Python libraries (e.g., via requirements.txt or pyproject.toml) to ensure reproducibility and prevent version conflicts.

4. Logging Mechanism - Replacing simple print() statements with structured, centralized logging (e.g., using Python's logging module that outputs to stdout/stderr, which the orchestrator collects).

# Infrastructure and Security Gaps
1. Database Connection String/Secrets - The database credentials (username, password, host, port) cannot be hardcoded. They must be managed securely using a secrets manager (e.g., Airflow Connections, AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).

2. Database Access Control - The user running the Python script needs specific, minimal permissions (Read/Write to target schemas/tables only), not superuser access.

3. File Storage and Access - If the CSVs are not local, you need secure access to cloud storage (e.g., S3, GCS) via service accounts or roles, replacing simple local file paths.

4. Environment Variables - Configuration values (e.g., database schema names, file paths, batch sizes) should be configurable via environment variables, rather than being hardcoded in the Python script.

# Code and Data Robustness Gaps - Your initial code works, but a production version must handle failures, variations, and security.
1. Idempotency - The solution must be designed so that running it multiple times (due to retries or manual rerun) does not result in duplicate or incorrect data. This often involves using a staging table, transaction blocks, or an UPSERT (merge) strategy in SQL.

2. Data Validation/Schema Checks - Logic to ensure the input CSVs meet expected schema, data types, and constraints before loading into the database. Handling bad records (quarantining them or alerting).

3. Error Handling (Try/Except) - Implementing robust try...except blocks in Python, specifically around file I/O, network calls, and database transactions, to provide clear, actionable error messages instead of crashing the task.

4. SQL Separation - Move the raw .sql file logic into a separate, parameterized template (e.g., a .sql file read by your Python code) so it can be managed and versioned independently of the Python logic.
